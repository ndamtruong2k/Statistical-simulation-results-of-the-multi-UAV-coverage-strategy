# Statistical-simulation-results-of-the-multi-UAV-coverage-strategy
The obtained to evaluate the performance of the proposed multi-UAV coverage strategy for the V-shaped formation.

The resulting simulation uses 20 different maps and robot numbers and 3 different algorithms for evaluation.

Matlab software is used to analyze the images after simulation and make comparisons based on the statistics.
## Maps
The generated maps are used as inputs to this simulation [here](https://github.com/ndamtruong2k/Statistical-simulation-results-of-the-multi-UAV-coverage-strategy/tree/main/Map).
## The Results
After simulating Op-RCPP, [here](https://github.com/ndamtruong2k/Statistical-simulation-results-of-the-multi-UAV-coverage-strategy/tree/main/Op) are the results.

After simulating nonOp-RCPP, [here](https://github.com/ndamtruong2k/Statistical-simulation-results-of-the-multi-UAV-coverage-strategy/tree/main/Bad) are the results.

After simulating Grid-based, [here](https://github.com/ndamtruong2k/Statistical-simulation-results-of-the-multi-UAV-coverage-strategy/tree/main/Grid) are the results.
## The statistics
Statistical simulation results of the multi-UAV coverage strategy using V-shaped formation with 3, 5, 7 UAVs, and different coverage paths.
